I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Tulane University working under Dr. Nicolas Mattei.  Prior to starting my PhD, I worked as a software engineer desigining scalable, distributed systems and recommendation engines.  I took a 2.5 year break from my PhD work (after completing Master's requirements) to work as a Machine Learning Engineer training, evaluating, deploying, and monitoring at a Computer Vision startup.  Eventually I became Director of Artificial Intelligence where I led three teams - Applied Machine Learning, Machine Learning Software Engineering, and Data Quality.

As of Fall 2024, I have returned to Tulane to resume my PhD work.  My research interests are in AI ethics, reinforcement learning, learning from demonstrations, constraint learning, and constraint transfer.
